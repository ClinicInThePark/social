# Week 5 team social event 

Team Clinic in the Park 

Eric Acampora,Eddie Duong, Hugo Polanco, Ka Lun Lee 

As a group, we decided to meet at University Town Center to have lunch and discuss the assignments that were due this week. After we finished eating, we worked on our tech talk together. We were recently provided with a document listing all the requirements for our client so as a group we went through and elaborated on what we needed to do to fulfill the requirements. Since we couldn't meet with our sponsor this week due to every group member being occuiped with midterms, we had to figure out a time to reschedule, which will be on Monday, May 5th.
