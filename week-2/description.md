# Week 2 team social event

Team Clinic in the Park 

Eric Acampora,Eddie Duong, Hugo Polanco, Ka Lun Lee 

As a group we went to In-N-Out for dinner. We decided to take a selfie capturing our moment and then learned more about ourselves. We talked about classes we've taken, where we are now in school, different jobs that we either work on now or are interested in, as well as ideas for how to approach the project. None of us had previously gone to a type of social event like this since they were never made "mandatory" in another class (except 151). Overall, it was a good experience for everyone.
